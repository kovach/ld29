Slow progress

 - Last night, learned the basics of quaternion rotations and made a simple animation hook
 - Today, learned some finer points of rotation and added some basic camera movement.
 - Made use of three.js's projection/raytracing classes to support interaction with objects:
{% highlight javascript %}
  // mouse x, y, normalized by screen dimensions
  var vector = v(x, y, 1);
  projector.unprojectVector(vector, camera);
  var origin = camera.position;
  var ray = new THREE.Raycaster(origin,
      vector.sub(origin).normalize());
  // pass the list of meshes to test
  var objs = ray.intersectObjects(blob_objects);
{% endhighlight %}

The current version of the game will always be [here]({{site.baseurl}}/game.html).

Controls:

 - `left-click` to orient the camera and select an object, then `w` to move to it.
 - `right-click` to orient and move simultaneously
 - `e` to turn around 180 degrees
 - `a` and `d` to roll around the camera axis
