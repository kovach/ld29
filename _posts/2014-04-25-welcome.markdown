Hello LD!

I've been vaguely planning a 3d game set in a very sparse, "large" world for the past week.  I want to explore three main things:

 - how to create a sense of scale
 - the movement possibilities from jumping between free-floating objects
 - building more structure (adding movement possibilities) as you go along

I've also, separately, been intending to build a tool for exploring [inversive
geometry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversive_geometry)... hopefully I will
come up with a compelling way to explore what's "beneath the surface."
